# Simple php login page 
I used a databse that was given to me in class in order to make a simple login in page that checks the users credentials. 
When the user types in their information if checks the database and if the information comes back true it would allow the user to go the next page.
If the credentials wasnt correct it would oyutput a messgae and bring them back to the home screen
